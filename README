Puush Catalog
===========
This program was written to exploit <a href="http://puu.sh>Puush's</a> poor storing of user data. You input the URL of a puush that you want to start with and the amount that you want the program to find after that.

Puush transforms a raw ID number into a alphanumeric string, so it's very easy to get the url of any puush as long as your know the number.

I created this program mostly to show people why you should not puush any sensitive information in the form of images or any other file type.
